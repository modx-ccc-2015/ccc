# Wishlist
The overall repository with MODX issues to tackle together at the MODX CCC 2015. This place is meant to be as a "big pond of possibilities": new MODX features, enhancement of existing features, old issues that really need to be fixed, stuff around MODX to make things easier. Please feel free to let your mind wander.

P.S.: Yes, we f'ed up the URL. :-( "whishlist" should be "wishlist". Sorry! We don't want to change that now but we will do it later.
