#Loose list of ideas for fixes

I should write more issues. Most of the things I keep ranting about never make it to the issue tracker. Shame on me.

##Spicing up the uber searchbar

Searching for resources/elements in the uberbar is very limited. I would like to see search by fieldname for resources and by id for elements.

An optional search by a complex json string would be even more awesome.

##Get rid of style inconsistancies for tvs moved by form customization

If you move tvs to modx-resource-main-left/right there are a whole lot of things going wrong...

##Changing xtype settings for some system settings to numberfield

xtype numberfield is only used for 'root_tree_id' all other system settings that require a number (site_start, etc) are set to textfield

##Add numberfield to list of available xtypes for new system settings

Its not in the list.

* To be announced...

#Loose list of ideas for plugins/extensions

##Make managerBreadCrumbs a standalone plugin

modDevTools by argnist shows breadcrumbs below each resource pagetitle.
They are quite useful and I think they should be a standalone extension.
